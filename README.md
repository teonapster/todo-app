# TodoApp
This project developed just for personal fun and exersizing with some of the coolest technologies arround the Angular framework. Apart from the "fun" part there was a series of questions spinning arround in my head and finally push me to bring this small project to life.

1. Human memory is not that robust, how many times did you forget one of your critical daily todos? 
2. How many times did you find yourself following several steps & clicks just to log one simple todo through complicated platforms?
3. And how many times did you forget that one of your todos is logged in your mobile app which was not synchronized with your desktop app?

This project is not yet completed but its in a good shape to let you understand the main concept:
